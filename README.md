### 📝 Documentation Philosophy

> **Why I document everything:**

- 📚 **Knowledge Retention:** Future me will forget implementation details (especially XSLT logic!)
- 🤝 **Knowledge Sharing:** Help others facing similar healthcare IT integration challenges
- 💼 **Professional Portfolio:** Demonstrate capabilities to potential employers
- 🔍 **Problem Solving:** Writing forces clarity of thought and catches edge cases
- 📈 **Career Growth:** Track progression from intern to lead engineer
- 🏥 **Patient Safety:** Good documentation in healthcare IT can literally save lives

---

### 🎓 What I Learned on This Journey

**Technical Skills:**
- HL7 v2.x is both elegant and frustrating (those pipe delimiters!)
- XSLT is powerful once you understand the paradigm shift from procedural thinking
- Mirth Connect is industry-standard for good reason (but JavaScript transformers > XSLT for complex logic)
- Customer-facing communication matters as much as technical skills

**Career Skills:**
- Rapid promotion comes from solving problems others avoid
- Being the "go-to person" for a critical technology is valuable
- Documentation and knowledge sharing build trust with teams
- Bridging clinical and technical worlds is a rare and valuable skill

**Life Balance:**
- Burnout is real - sustainable pace beats heroic sprints
- Learning new skills requires structured time, not just "whenever I have time"
